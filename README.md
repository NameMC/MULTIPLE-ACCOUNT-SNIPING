# I. Introduction
Welcome to my guide on how to snipe using multiple accounts. 
When sniping Minecraft names, it's a huge advantage to use more than 1 account; it allows you to send more name change requests, thus, bettering your chances at securing the name. By default, you are only able to send 2 name change requests per IP before the rest are omitted. This normally limits you from being able to use more than 1 account, but people have found loopholes in order to bypass this restriction.

# II. Disclaimers
Before I walk you through how to snipe using multiple accounts, I must list some disclaimers which may prohibit you from using this loophole:

- Obviously, you need more than 1 Minecraft account to use this trick
- You or someone else must have a credit card able to be used for beginning a free trial

You must also be aware that this guide only covers how to set up a `VPS` (explained later on) using Amazon's Cloud Computing Services / Amazon Web Services. 
This guide does not show you how to set up an `SSH`, but rather a basic `VPS` that is eligible for sniping. More about this later on.

> This guide was started on July 30th, 2021. There is no guarantee this guide will still be useful / functional in the future. If Mojang decides to change how sniping works (and making this guide useless), I will state so when we have news of such.

# III. Explanation
So how exactly are we going to work around the 2 name change request limit? 
Well, as was stated before, this limit is only applied **per IP**. So theoretically, each IP has 2 requests maximum. If you are able to send requests from more than 1 IP, you could technically send more than 2 requests in total. By using a `VPS` (Virtual Private Server) you could emulate another PC and IP address. 
I don't want to get too deep in the technicalities of what defines a `VPS` or what one really is. Instead, I am going to list extremely simple steps which should allow you to launch and prepare your `VPS(s)` for sniping.

# Discontinued

I'm sorry to announce that this article will never reach completion, as [Mojang condemns sniping with bots](https://twitter.com/Mojang_Ined/status/1448652087043133440). I cannot and will not publicly incite sniping if it poses any risk to me, so sadly, this guide will be left unfinished. If you need help with VPS sniping and are willing to take the risk, consult people [in a sniping Discord](https://discord.gg/FhcPQrX5EX) for an explanation.
