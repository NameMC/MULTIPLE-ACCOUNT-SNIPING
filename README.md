# I. Introduction
Welcome to my guide on how to snipe using multiple accounts. 
When sniping Minecraft names, it's a huge advantage to use more than 1 account; it allows you to send more name change requests, thus, bettering your chances at securing the name. By default, you are only able to send 2 name change requests per IP before the rest are omitted. This normally limits you from being able to use more than 1 account, but people have found loopholes in order to bypass this restriction.

# II. Disclaimers
Before I walk you through how to snipe using multiple accounts, I must list some disclaimers which may prohibit you from using this loophole:

- Obviously, you need more than 1 Minecraft account to use this trick
- You or someone else must have a credit card able to be used for beginning a free trial

You must also be aware that this guide only covers how to set up a `VPS` (explained later on) using Amazon's Cloud Computing Services / Amazon Web Services. 
This guide does not show you how to set up an `SSH`, but rather a basic `VPS` that is eligible for sniping. More about this later on.

> This guide was started on July 30th, 2021. There is no guarantee this guide will still be useful / functional in the future. If Mojang decides to change how sniping works (and making this guide useless), I will state so when we have news of such.

# III. Explanation
So how exactly are we going to work around the 2 name change request limit? 
Well, as was stated before, this limit is only applied **per IP**. So theoretically, each IP has 2 requests maximum. If you are able to send requests from more than 1 IP, you could technically send more than 2 requests in total. By using a `VPS` (Virtual Private Server) you could emulate another PC and IP address. 
I don't want to get too deep in the technicalities of what defines a `VPS` or what one really is. Instead, I am going to list extremely simple steps which should allow you to launch and prepare your `VPS(s)` for sniping.

If you have any problems following these steps you can contact me by Discord:

# IV. Sign up for AWS

The first step is creating an account on the official [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/). After you have made an account, begin the free trial for AWS. Select the EC2 750 Hours plan:
